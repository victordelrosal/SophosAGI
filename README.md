SophosAGI is an AGI-readiness organization advised by an AI board.

We engage in training, research, collaboration, and advocacy to ensure that AGI serves the common good and benefits humanity as a whole.

It is part of an international research initiative to understand the potential consequences of (human-level) artificial general intelligence (AGI).

<h2>Mission</h2> 
Our mission is to prepare society for the arrival of human-level artificial general intelligence (AGI), ensuring its development benefits all of humanity.

SophosAGI seeks to help society navigate the complex landscape of AGI and its potential consequences, fostering an informed and responsible approach to this transformative technology.

<h3>Focus areas</h3> 

▶ Create awareness about artificial general intelligence (AGI), how it works, its benefits and potential threats, etc.

▶ Help key stakeholders and decision-makers navigate the complex landscape of AGI and its potential consequences.

▶ Explore the challenges and opportunities presented by the development of AGI across all sectors of society. 

<h3>AI Advisory Board</h3> 

SophosAGI is run by a human executive team, advised by a unique AI Advisory Board consisting of 25 AI-generated members, ensuring a comprehensive representation of diverse stakeholder perspectives.

The executive team is supported by an AI Advisory Board created with and powered by GPT-4. 

AI advisors provide guidance and insights to help SophosAGI navigate the complex landscape of AGI and its potential implications. 

While board members are fictitious, it is a simulation that aims to draw from a diverse range of knowledge and expertise, while maintaining an unbiased and balanced perspective.

<h3>Primary goals</h3>

▶ Raise awareness: encourage access to objective, balanced, in-depth information about the concept of AI and AGI, its technical specifications, design principles, potential benefits, risks, and the current state of research. 

▶ Highlight ethical implications: emphasize the importance of ethical considerations and responsible development of AGI technology.

▶ Promote understanding: break down complex concepts and technical jargon into understandable language, making AGI-related information accessible to a wider audience. This enables more people to participate in conversations and decision-making processes around AGI.

▶ Encourage collaboration: promote open dialogue between various stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, industry leaders, and the general public, to facilitate cooperation and knowledge-sharing in the development of AGI.

▶ Provide guidance and training: offer best practices and recommendations for individuals and organizations to prepare for the potential impacts of AGI. This may include strategies for job preparedness, skill development, and business adaptation in anticipation of an increasingly automated world.

▶ Address misconceptions: aim to dispel common myths,  misconceptions, and misinformation surrounding AGI, fostering a more accurate and nuanced understanding of the technology and its implications.

▶ Support research and innovation: share valuable research findings, advancements, and insights from the AGI research community, in order to contribute to the ongoing development of safe and beneficial AGI technologies.

<h3>Core activities</h3>

▶ Research: we conduct interdisciplinary research on AGI, exploring its potential risks and benefits, as well as the ethical, social, and economic dimensions of its development and deployment.

▶ Education: we develop and offer educational programs, resources, and workshops to raise awareness about AGI, foster critical thinking, and build a community of informed individuals who can actively contribute to AGI readiness.

▶ Collaboration: we collaborate with researchers, institutions, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to promote open dialogue, share knowledge, and develop best practices for AGI development and governance.

▶ Advocacy: we advocate for responsible and ethical AGI development, emphasizing the need for transparency, inclusivity, and public engagement in shaping the future of AGI.

▶ Outreach: we engage with the public, governments, and organizations to promote understanding of AGI, its potential impact on society, and the importance of preparing for its arrival.

By combining research, education, collaboration, advocacy, and outreach, Sophos aims to ensure that society is well-equipped to address the challenges and opportunities that AGI will bring, ultimately fostering a future where AGI benefits all of humanity.

Note: the meeting started at 11:00 but had to be paused at 11:45 because of the 25-message cap on the GPT-4 Model. Will aim to resume in the afternoon.

Update: I have just reached out to the OpenAI team asking if this limit could be eased.
